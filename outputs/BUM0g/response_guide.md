## Executive Summary

This RFP seeks the development of a modern, dynamic web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The primary deliverable is a professional website that showcases the organization's services and includes an integrated job application portal. Key features include informational website pages, a careers portal with job listings and filtering, a job application module, and a secure admin dashboard for managing content and applications. The client prioritizes scalability, security, and usability, catering to both public users and internal administrators. Critical success factors include a robust technical architecture, a user-friendly interface, and a secure application portal. To win this bid, the recommended approach is to demonstrate a deep understanding of the MERN stack, emphasizing secure coding practices, efficient data management, and a responsive design. The proposal should clearly outline the proposed architecture, development process, and deployment strategy, highlighting the team's experience with similar projects and a commitment to delivering a high-quality, scalable, and maintainable website and job application portal. The proposal should also showcase the ability to integrate with cloud-based storage solutions for resume uploads and provide a detailed plan for security, including password hashing, JWT authentication, and CORS policies.
