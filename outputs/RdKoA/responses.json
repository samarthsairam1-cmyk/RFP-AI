Explain how retro documents are utilized. How is user feedback incorporated into your products? Please share an example.  \n\nAt Stealth, retrospectives are an important part of how we work. After every project sprint, we gather the team to discuss what went well, what did not, and how we can improve. The outcome is documented and reviewed regularly to ensure we learn from every phase. We also take user feedback seriously. For example, in our CHAMPS project with USAID, we consistently gathered feedback from end users and adjusted the system to better fit their needs. This helped us make the system more user-friendly and efficient.\n\n2 \n\nWhat does your organization consider when designing a web application and how are challenges met that arise that were not part of the original design? \n\nWhen designing web applications, we focus on the user experience, security, scalability, and compliance with federal standards like FedRAMP. If something unexpected comes up that was not part of the original plan, we follow Agile methods to adjust and improve as we go. For example, in the CHAMPS project, we ran into challenges with data migration. By revisiting our design and making security tweaks, we were able to overcome those hurdles while staying compliant with security protocols.\n\n3 \n\nWhat sorts of applications has your organization built and what kinds of technologies were used? What are some technologies your teams are interested in trying out? When designing a system how does your organization determine whether to use a lambda versus a container system like EKS or EC2?\n\n--- NTIA Technical Proposal WebDevServs_SSI.pdf ---\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/ SOURCE SELECTION INFORMATION -SEE FAR 2.101, 3.104,AND 42.1503 \n-Stealth is very conscious of timeliness and the project schedule-revilewed and \nupdated weekly In standing meetings with the COR, SO, and Product Owner. \n-The team is geographically spread across the U.S. and India, wlth all team \nmembers working closely to address customer and client requests in a timely and \ncomprehens ive manner. \nCOST CONTROLJ The current rating is based on feedback/ inputs provided by the Technical Lead of \nBureau Africai \n-Stealth leadership is very conscious of cost management and control -bringing \nup any concerns as needed in 'W\u20acekly meetings with the COR, and on an ad-hoc basis, \nas needed.
