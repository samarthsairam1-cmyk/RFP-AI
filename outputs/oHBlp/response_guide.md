## Executive Summary

This RFP, issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), seeks a qualified vendor to modernize several public web applications using Drupal 10 on the Acquia platform. The primary goal is to improve efficiency, reduce costs, enhance user experience, and ensure compliance with security requirements, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Zero Trust (ZT). The key deliverables include auditing the current Drupal configuration, comparing search engine options (Search.gov vs. Acquia-SOLR), creating a Reusable Application Framework (RAF), setting up development environments, and modernizing several specific applications. The client's primary evaluation criteria will likely focus on the vendor's technical expertise in Drupal and Acquia, past performance, proposed technical approach, project management capabilities, and cost-effectiveness. Critical success factors for winning this bid include demonstrating a deep understanding of USFWS objectives, showcasing relevant experience with Drupal 10 and Acquia, providing a comprehensive technical plan, and highlighting a strong project management approach. The recommended high-level approach involves emphasizing Team Stealth's experience with Drupal and Acquia, particularly with clients like the Department of Commerce and GSA. The response should clearly articulate the proposed technical plan, including the multi-application approach, the RAF, and the migration strategy. The proposal should also highlight the team's past performance, project management capabilities, and cost-effective solutions.
