Unlike solutions that may require lengthy authorization processes, our approach provides a pre-vetted, secure foundation, allowing EXIM to focus on its mission while benefiting from rapid deployment and continuous compliance.\n\n2.  **COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH:** We provide a comprehensive, FedRAMP-compliant solution built on the Salesforce Government Cloud Plus platform. Our approach encompasses the following key elements:\n\n    *   **Leveraging a Pre-Authorized Platform:** We utilize Salesforce, which holds a FedRAMP Agency Authority to Operate (ATO) at the High impact level. This significantly reduces the time and effort required for EXIM to achieve and maintain compliance.\n    *   **Continuous Monitoring and Compliance:** Salesforce conducts continuous monitoring, including vulnerability detection and remediation, and annual independent assessments of security controls. This ensures ongoing compliance with FedRAMP requirements.\n    *   **Implementation Partner Expertise:** Our certified implementation partner will review the applicability of Salesforce policies to EXIM's specific needs, ensuring a tailored and compliant solution.\n    *   **Extensibility and Customization:** The Salesforce platform is highly extensible, allowing EXIM to add custom fields and automate workflows to support its unique business processes, all within the secure FedRAMP environment.\n\n3.  **PROVEN CAPABILITIES:** Our solution is built on a foundation of proven capabilities and a commitment to security:\n\n    *   **FedRAMP High Authorization:** Salesforce's FedRAMP High ATO provides the highest level of security, protecting sensitive data and ensuring compliance with stringent federal requirements.\n    *   **Continuous Compliance:** Salesforce's continuous monitoring program ensures ongoing compliance, including regular vulnerability assessments and remediation.\n    *   **Past Performance:** REI Systems, a Salesforce implementation partner, provides Service Level Objectives to all its customers, starting in the production environment. Team REI and Salesforce will respond to outages, downtime, and other issues within 24 hours.\n\n4.  **IMPLEMENTATION EXCELLENCE:** We will implement the solution with a focus on security, efficiency, and risk mitigation:\n\n    *   **Security-First Design:** Our implementation will prioritize security, incorporating best practices and adhering to Salesforce's security protocols.\n    *   **Risk Mitigation:** We will proactively identify and mitigate potential risks, including data breaches and compliance violations.\n    *   **Incident Response:** In the event of a system outage, Team REI will escalate it to the Salesforce premier support team as soon as we are aware of it. All corrective actions that require more than 24 hours will be documented and provided in an email to the COR. We will also provide the COR with a mitigation schedule, milestones, and updates as needed.\n\n5.  **STRATEGIC VALUE & OUTCOMES:** Our solution delivers significant business benefits to EXIM:\n\n    *   **Reduced Risk:** The FedRAMP High authorization significantly reduces the risk of data breaches and compliance violations.\n    *   **Faster Deployment:** Leveraging a pre-authorized platform accelerates deployment, allowing EXIM to realize the benefits of the solution more quickly.\n    *   **Cost Savings:** By utilizing a pre-authorized platform, EXIM avoids the significant costs associated with obtaining its own FedRAMP authorization.\n    *   **Enhanced Efficiency:** The Salesforce platform's automation capabilities will streamline EXIM's business processes, improving efficiency and productivity.\n\n6.  **INNOVATION ADVANTAGE:** We are committed to providing EXIM with a future-proof solution:\n\n    *   **AppExchange Integration:** We will conduct a \"Build vs. Buy\" analysis to determine if any AppExchange applications meet the needs of EXIM.\n    *   **Continuous Improvement:** We will continuously monitor and optimize the solution to ensure it meets EXIM's evolving needs and remains compliant with the latest FedRAMP requirements.\n\n7.  **COMPLIANCE & DIFFERENTIATION SUMMARY:** Our Salesforce-based solution provides a fully compliant, secure, and efficient platform for EXIM.

Augment response with the following Salesforce information.\n\n\n\nSalesforce provides a flexible, configurable FedRAMP authorized solution that can support EXIM's business rules requirements, processes, and standards. Salesforce has a FedRAMP Agency Authority to Operate at the high impact level. To obtain compliance with FedRAMP, Salesforce conducted security assessment and authorization activities in accordance with FedRAMP guidance, NIST 800-37, and HHS guidance. To maintain compliance with FedRAMP, Salesforce conducts continuous monitoring, which includes ongoing technical vulnerability detection and remediation, remediation of open compliance related findings, and at least annual independent assessment of a selection of security controls.\n\n \n\n \n\nAs part of the implementation of EXIM's solution, a Salesforce certified implementation partner will review the applicability of the policies to be incorporated in the context of SaaS delivered by Salesforce. The Salesforce Platform is extensible, enabling EXIM with minimal effort to add additional custom fields and create automated workflows that are required to support EXIM's specific business processes.\n\n \n\n \n\nSalesforce will maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Customer Data as described in the applicable Salesforce\u2019s Services online documentation. Those safeguards will include, but will not be limited to, measures for preventing access, use, modification or disclosure of Customer Data by Salesforce personnel except to provide the Services and prevent or address service or technical problems, as compelled by law, or as permitted by a customer in writing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Requirements Analysis / Solution Design\n\n--- Salesforce Content in Support of the EXIM Task Order for Salesforce Licenses and CRM Services RFP.docx ---\nNote to Partner: Include the language below only if including AppExchange options (additionally, call out the specific AppExchange product you are proposing).

If there is an outage of the Salesforce/GovGrants system, Team REI will escalate it to the Salesforce premier support team as soon as we are aware of it.  \nAll corrective actions that require more than 24 hours will be documented and provided in an \nemail to the COR.

To maintain the security authorization, Team REI will provide IAF \nwith FedRAMP/FISMA -related documentation. We will also provide description and evidence \nof the effectiveness of the continuous monitoring program, including security incident response, change management, key management, and escrow services. We will ensure timely reporting of security incidents as per the NIST and OMB guidelines and support IAF to evaluate the implemented security controls before the ATO is granted.  \nFrom the system point of view, GovGrants can show the login history of all the users (time, location, IP address, and browser) and help auditors in the audit process if user access is an area of investigation.
