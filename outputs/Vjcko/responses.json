Agile\u00a0improves the process of delivery, encouraging quick changes in the functions and practices to better produce the envisioned product by the end user, whereas DevSecOps\u00a0improves the lead time and frequency of delivery outcomes through enhanced engineering practices; promoting a more cohesive collaboration between DevSecOps teams as they work towards continuous integration and delivery. Stealth\u2019s approach includes four leading practices with a series of tools in each area: \n\nAgile Development\n\nContinuous Integration\n\nContinuous Testing\n\nContinuous Delivery \n\nThese four practices have Continuous Feedback (CF) and Continuous Service Improvements (CSI) with metrics to measure, improve, and fine-tuning to get the desired results for customers. \n\n\n\nThis recommended approach meets today\u2019s government need for faster, cost-effective, and more secure solutions.\n\n\n\nPast Performance Example\n\nStealth Solutions has implemented multiple types of Salesforce projects and have executed different types of tasks for each of their projects.
