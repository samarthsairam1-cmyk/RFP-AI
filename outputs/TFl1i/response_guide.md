## Executive Summary

This RFQ seeks proposals for [insert the specific services or products being requested based on the SOW, if available]. The key deliverables include a Technical Proposal (10 pages), Past Performance documentation (10 pages), and a Price Volume (5 pages). The client's primary evaluation criteria are: Factor 1 – FedRAMP, Solution Overview & Capabilities Checklist, Factor 2 – Product Demonstration, Factor 3 – Price, and Factor 4 – Past Performance. Technical evaluation factor 1 is more important than technical evaluation factor 2, and both technical evaluation factors 1 and 2 combined are more important than price. Critical success factors include demonstrating a clear understanding of the requirements, providing a competitive price, and showcasing relevant past performance. To win this bid, the recommended approach is to: 1) Thoroughly address all requirements in each volume, 2) Highlight relevant experience and successes, 3) Provide a competitive and well-supported price, and 4) Ensure compliance with all formatting and submission instructions. Emphasize the ability to meet the requirements, rather than simply restating them. The government may award based on the initial quote, so a strong, complete proposal is essential.
