We have structured our pricing to be transparent, allowing [Client Name] to understand exactly where their investment is allocated. Our pricing model is based on a **fixed-price approach** for the initial implementation phase, providing budget certainty and minimizing financial risk. Subsequent phases, including ongoing support and maintenance, are priced on a **time and materials (T&M) basis**, allowing for flexibility and scalability as the project evolves. This hybrid approach ensures cost-effectiveness while maintaining the highest quality of service.
