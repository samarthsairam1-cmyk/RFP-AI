## FEDRAMP Authorization Details

1.  **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:** Our Salesforce-based solution for EXIM leverages a FedRAMP High authorized platform, ensuring the highest levels of security and compliance. Unlike solutions that may require lengthy authorization processes, our approach provides a pre-vetted, secure foundation, allowing EXIM to focus on its mission while benefiting from rapid deployment and continuous compliance.

2.  **COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH:** We provide a comprehensive, FedRAMP-compliant solution built on the Salesforce Government Cloud Plus platform. Our approach encompasses the following key elements:

    *   **Leveraging a Pre-Authorized Platform:** We utilize Salesforce, which holds a FedRAMP Agency Authority to Operate (ATO) at the High impact level. This significantly reduces the time and effort required for EXIM to achieve and maintain compliance.
    *   **Continuous Monitoring and Compliance:** Salesforce conducts continuous monitoring, including vulnerability detection and remediation, and annual independent assessments of security controls. This ensures ongoing compliance with FedRAMP requirements.
    *   **Implementation Partner Expertise:** Our certified implementation partner will review the applicability of Salesforce policies to EXIM's specific needs, ensuring a tailored and compliant solution.
    *   **Extensibility and Customization:** The Salesforce platform is highly extensible, allowing EXIM to add custom fields and automate workflows to support its unique business processes, all within the secure FedRAMP environment.

3.  **PROVEN CAPABILITIES:** Our solution is built on a foundation of proven capabilities and a commitment to security:

    *   **FedRAMP High Authorization:** Salesforce's FedRAMP High ATO provides the highest level of security, protecting sensitive data and ensuring compliance with stringent federal requirements.
    *   **Continuous Compliance:** Salesforce's continuous monitoring program ensures ongoing compliance, including regular vulnerability assessments and remediation.
    *   **Past Performance:** REI Systems, a Salesforce implementation partner, provides Service Level Objectives to all its customers, starting in the production environment. Team REI and Salesforce will respond to outages, downtime, and other issues within 24 hours.

4.  **IMPLEMENTATION EXCELLENCE:** We will implement the solution with a focus on security, efficiency, and risk mitigation:

    *   **Security-First Design:** Our implementation will prioritize security, incorporating best practices and adhering to Salesforce's security protocols.
    *   **Risk Mitigation:** We will proactively identify and mitigate potential risks, including data breaches and compliance violations.
    *   **Incident Response:** In the event of a system outage, Team REI will escalate it to the Salesforce premier support team as soon as we are aware of it. All corrective actions that require more than 24 hours will be documented and provided in an email to the COR. We will also provide the COR with a mitigation schedule, milestones, and updates as needed.

5.  **STRATEGIC VALUE & OUTCOMES:** Our solution delivers significant business benefits to EXIM:

    *   **Reduced Risk:** The FedRAMP High authorization significantly reduces the risk of data breaches and compliance violations.
    *   **Faster Deployment:** Leveraging a pre-authorized platform accelerates deployment, allowing EXIM to realize the benefits of the solution more quickly.
    *   **Cost Savings:** By utilizing a pre-authorized platform, EXIM avoids the significant costs associated with obtaining its own FedRAMP authorization.
    *   **Enhanced Efficiency:** The Salesforce platform's automation capabilities will streamline EXIM's business processes, improving efficiency and productivity.

6.  **INNOVATION ADVANTAGE:** We are committed to providing EXIM with a future-proof solution:
