This RFP from the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) seeks comprehensive website management and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) services to support recruiting efforts for the Department of the Air Force (DAF), including Active Duty, Air National Guard (ANG), Reserves, and Space Force.

Key evaluation criteria include demonstrated experience in website management, SEO, AI-driven personalization, and compliance with all stated requirements. Critical success factors involve showcasing a deep understanding of DAF recruiting objectives, proposing innovative solutions (e.g., AI chatbots, PWA capabilities), and providing a clear plan for ongoing maintenance, security, and reporting. The recommended approach is to emphasize a mobile-first design, AI-driven personalization, and a robust SEO strategy. The proposal should highlight the ability to integrate with existing DAF systems, provide actionable insights through advanced analytics, and ensure compliance with all DoD cybersecurity and accessibility standards. The proposal should also clearly articulate a plan for maintaining the recruiter locator functionality and developing a website creative strategy.
