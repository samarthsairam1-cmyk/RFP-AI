{"executive_summary": "This Request for Information (RFI) from the Social Security Administration (SSA) seeks information on potential Web Content Management System (WCMS) solutions based on the Drupal platform. The SSA aims to enhance its digital presence and improve content management. The key deliverable is a comprehensive WCMS solution, including Platform as a Service (PaaS) hosting, FedRAMP certification, and support for SSA's technical and security requirements. The primary evaluation criteria will likely focus on the solution's ability to meet SSA's technical specifications, security compliance (FedRAMP, NIST, FISMA), scalability, Section 508 compliance, and the vendor's experience and capabilities. Critical success factors include demonstrating a robust, secure, and scalable Drupal-based WCMS solution with a proven track record, particularly within government agencies. The recommended approach is to provide a detailed capability statement that directly addresses all requirements, emphasizing the solution's compliance with FedRAMP, Section 508, and other security standards. Highlight the PaaS environment, deployment management capabilities, and the ability to integrate with SSA's CDN and reverse proxy. Include all required documentation, such as the VPAT and Corporate Information Template, and clearly mark any proprietary information.", "submission_structure": [{"section": "Capability Statement", "description": "A detailed statement demonstrating expertise in the areas described in the RFI.
