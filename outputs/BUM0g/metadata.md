## Summary

This RFP outlines the requirements for the development of a modern, dynamic website and integrated job application portal. The core objective is to create a professional online presence that effectively showcases the company's services while streamlining the recruitment process. The client seeks a scalable, secure, and user-friendly web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The project addresses the business challenge of enhancing the company's online brand image, improving candidate experience, and automating the job application workflow. The solution will include informational website pages, a careers portal with job listings and search functionality, a job application module, and a secure admin dashboard for managing job postings and applications. The project's unique aspects include the use of cloud-based object storage for resumes (AWS S3 or Cloudinary) and the emphasis on scalability, security, and usability for both public visitors and internal administrators. The successful implementation will provide a robust platform for attracting talent and managing the company's online presence.
