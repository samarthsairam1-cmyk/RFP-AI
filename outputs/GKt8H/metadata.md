## Summary

This Request for Quotation (RFQ) is issued by the IT Acquisition Center of Excellence (ACE) on behalf of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), a part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The core purpose of this RFQ is to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for Web Agility Program Support Services (WA3). The DOT aims to procure services to support the daily operations and maintenance of its web platforms, including the Drupal Content Management System (CMS), and to facilitate the design, development, and integration of new web-based applications and content. The client seeks a solution that addresses the need for innovative, best-in-class websites and web infrastructure to support DOT's goals. The key business challenge is to maintain and enhance the DOT's digital presence, ensuring accessibility, compliance with federal standards, and a positive user experience. This RFQ is set aside for small businesses, with the FHWA anticipating awarding approximately four BPA awards. The scope includes project management, operations and maintenance, design and development, content strategy, accessibility compliance, and website analytics support. The BPA will utilize Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Time & Materials (T&M)/Labor Hour (LH), or hybrid contract types.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Phase I:** {'factor_1': 'Technical Approach', 'factor_2': 'Corporate Experience'}
- **Phase Ii:** {'factor_3': 'Technical Approach', 'factor_4': 'Management Approach', 'factor_5': 'Price'}
- **Basis For Award:** Best-value decision developed from a trade-off analysis, considering the evaluation of factors from both Phase I and Phase II. Technical Approach (Factor 1 and Factor 3), Management Approach, and Corporate Experience will be utilized as the technical/non-price related factors in the analysis and are listed above in descending order of importance. All non-price factors, when combined, will be significantly more important than Price. If two or more quotations are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e., are technically equivalent), an award may be made to the lower-priced quotations. However, award may also be made to other than the lowest priced quotations if the Government determines that a higher price is warranted due to technical merit denoted in the evaluation. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotations, if the Government determines that a higher price is not the best value.
