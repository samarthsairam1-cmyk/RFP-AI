## Executive Summary

This Request for Information (RFI) from the Social Security Administration (SSA) seeks information on Web Content Management System (WCMS) solutions based on the Drupal platform, including cloud hosting and Content Delivery Network (CDN) services. The SSA aims to enhance its digital presence and improve content management. Key deliverables include a PaaS environment for Drupal, FedRAMP-certified hosting, and streamlined deployment management. The primary evaluation criteria will likely focus on the solution's ability to meet technical requirements (scalability, CDN integration, security), hosting capabilities, system support, Section 508 compliance, and the vendor's experience. Critical success factors include demonstrating a robust, secure, and scalable Drupal-based WCMS solution that aligns with federal standards. The recommended approach involves a detailed capability statement addressing all listed questions, showcasing the solution's features, compliance with FedRAMP and Section 508, and providing clear pricing and support information. Emphasize the PaaS offering, FedRAMP certification, and the ability to meet SSA's specific technical requirements, including scalability and integration with a CDN and SSA's network. Include all required templates and documentation, and clearly mark any proprietary information.
